An Electrical Engineer obsessed with optimization: networks, databases, infrastructure, cloud, backup, home automation, and the occasional coding spree. An experienced tinkerer in power electronics, neurometrics, and security systems.  
  
I design large-scale networks that make Wi-Fi routers weep in inferiority, build mobile systems that donâ€™t collapse under real users, and sneak efficiency into manufacturing with computer-aided solutions. Cloud and backup are my insurance policies: Iâ€™ve rescued more businesses from digital amnesia than anyone wants to admit.  
  
My career has touched just about: healthcare, airlines, travel agencies, restaurants, hotels, media, schools, and even auction systems. If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s un-apologetically over-optimized and addicted to tinkering, youâ€™ve found your hire.
